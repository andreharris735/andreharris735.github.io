<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
    My name is Andre Harris. I am a Junior at North Carolina A&T State University. I am originally from Manassas Park,
    Virginia. I chose A&T because I wanted to go to an HBCU and NCAT has the best Computer Science program. In Computer
    Science, I want to focus on Software Development, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. Outside of coding,
    I lead Bible Studies on NCAT's campus. I enjoy teaching people about the Word of God and the love of Jesus.
